            <p>
            Aloha, I’m a front-end developer located on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.  I have a serious passion for technology and learning all the things to make technology work for me. 
            </p>
            <p>
            When i’m not tinkering with the latest gadget, you can find me surfing Hawaii's waves, on a beach volleyball court or vacationing at a ski resort breaking another collar bone. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Other than sports and technology, I am very much a family person and faith oriented. Both keep me grounded and make me want to be the best version of myself. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Overall, im trying to meet like-minded people who can mentor me to make me a stronger Web Developer, a smarter employee and a more wholesome and selfless  person in general. 
            </p>
